video:
 - fix orientations: sometimes screen policy comes to rom gallery, sometimes policy miss settings view

input:
 s pad view config
 s on-screen paddle controller (e.g. arkanoid)
 s on-screen zapper controller (e.g. duck hunts)
 s accelerometer as a controller
 s use accelerometer at the save's view and rom gallery

roms:
 o copy info about roms
 s load roms from zipped files
 - IPS patcher
 s on device rom remove

misc:
 o change game_config.txt path
 s qml need a skeleton - too much code is copy pasted
 o bug in steering: when swiping pad don't work
 - give users ability to choose their own images in ROM gallery
 - currently when you click play new windows and machine is created, it takes time (especially when you click pause first time)
   in order to minimize this time I will reimplement this mechanism so only disk will be reloaded (it should be done this way from beginning)
 - mappers 72-255
 - sometimes crash on pause
 - should detect if USB cable is connected
 xs make icons in home screen removable
 - for Amiga create readme.txt about rom folders and roms name policy
 s game policy http://library.developer.nokia.com/index.jsp?topic=/MeeGo_1.2_Harmattan_API/html/guide/html/Developer_Library_Best_practices_for_application_development_Using_Resource_Policy_to_enhance_games_a32a.html
 - Meegotouch Control Panel http://www.developer.nokia.com/Community/Wiki/SettingsApplet
 - translations
 s more consoles: GB, SNES, C64, Amiga, ...
 o bug testing
 - support for debugging
 - test PAL for NES
 - catch load/save errors

issues:
 - kick master (mapper 4) not working

audio:
 s nesapu performance

net play:
 - full sync
 - pause on 20ms delay (convert time to cycles) and no data
